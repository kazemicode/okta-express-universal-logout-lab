You'll also need to create an [OpenID Connect (OIDC) application](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcode/main/#set-up-your-app), which you can do by following the instructions listed here under Setup your app. Set the Sign-in redirect URI as `http://localhost:3333/openid/callback/1`. Note down your ***client_id** and **client_secret**; you'll need it in the next steps."
