Notice we are building the [`/global-token-revocation`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/oauth/tag/GlobalTokenRevocation/) endpoint here.\n\nThis will initiate the global revocation of all tokens and sessions for a specified user enabling external Identity Providers to trigger a comprehensive sign-out process. This includes executing IdP-initiated sign-out flows across all applications that are using global token revocation and requiring users to re-authenticate to access protected resources.\n\nAs you might guess, we will need the user object as part of this process. In the next step, we will add code to get a user by email.",

As per the [Global Token Revocation Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-parecki-oauth-global-token-revocation#name-revocation-request), we are expecting an external request to end a user's session based on the email used to sign in to the app through their IdP. The request will look like the following:\n\n```\nPOST /global-token-revocation\\\nHost: example.com\\\nContent-Type: application/json\\\n{\\\n\"sub_id\": {\\\n    \"format\": \"email\",\\\n    \"email\": \"user@example.com\"\\\n}\\\n}\n```\n\n1. Open a new terminal window, be sure to set the [port to public within Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace) and send the following cURL request to check your code:\n\n    ```\n    curl --request POST \\\n    --url https://{yourCodespaceUrl}-3000.app.github.dev/global-token-revocation \\\n    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    --data '{\n    \"sub_id\": {\n        \"format\": \"email\",\n        \"email\": \"trinity@whiterabbit.fake\"\n    }\n    }'\n    ```\n\n    Switching to your other Terminal tab where you ran `npm run`, you will see that this request results in a 204 response confirming that a user named Trinity exists and her sessions have been deleted. While we got a successful response, this endpoint isn't secure; we've made it available for anyone to access! Let's fix this by adding authentication to protect this endpoint and establish trust between our server and any external service making a request to this route.",
